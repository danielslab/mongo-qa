driver:
        1. Use the database test1 at 127.0.0.1:27017
        2. Create a collection part1 with 100 elements of the form { x : i } for i=0 to 99.

validator:
        1. Ensure the collection part1 has 100 elements
        2. Ensure part1 contains elements { x : i } for i=0 to 99

Notes:
Running this test multiple times will make part1 contain 100 more elements each time, so the driver writer is advised to drop the collection before populating.
