setup:
        1. drop collection dbs_1
        2. drop collection dbs_2
        3. drop collection dbs_3

driver:
        1. Save { foo : "bar" } to the collection dbs_1 
        2. Save { psi : "phi" } to the collection dbs_2
        3. print the name of this database
        4. print a list of collections in this database starting with "dbs" in alphabetical order
        5. drop the collection dbs_1
        6. explicitly create a collection called dbs_3
        7. print a list of collections in this database starting with "dbs" in alphabetical order

validate:
        1. check that dbs_2 and dbs_3 exist

expected output:
driver_test_framework
dbs_1
dbs_2
dbs_2
dbs_3
